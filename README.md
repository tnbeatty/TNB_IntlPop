This project uses a couple of open-source tools. They include the following:

###Foundation

####Overview

The [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) CSS framework was very useful for quickly producing a clean layout that scales easily.

####Editing the CSS

You can either make edits to the CSS files directly, or edit the SCSS provided as described in the [Zurb Documentation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html). To do so, you will need to install the compass gem. To get going, watch the SCSS files for changes by running `compass watch` in the project directoy. The `config.rb` file is set up so that you don't need to specify files to watch, etc.

###Angular JS
